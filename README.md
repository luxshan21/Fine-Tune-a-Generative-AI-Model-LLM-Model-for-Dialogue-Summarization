# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Enhanced Dialogue Summarization

This project involves fine-tuning an existing Large Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization.

## Project Overview
- Utilized the **Hugging Face Dialogue Summarization Dataset** to train the model.
- Employed the **FLAN-T5 model**, known for its high-quality, instruction-tuned capabilities, which can summarize text out of the box.
- Explored a **full fine-tuning approach** to enhance inferences and evaluated the results using **ROUGE metrics**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **PyTorch**
- **LLM (Large Language Models)**
- **Python**
- **Amazon SageMaker**
